/**
 * `agentLifecycle` domain (L6) — flat registry of the session's agents.
 *
 * Owns agent *existence* — the creation pipeline (`create` / `fork`), the
 * registry (`get` / `list` / `remove`), and the lifecycle events — plus the
 * session-wide fan-outs only the live registry can reach
 * (`broadcastPermissionMode`). Driving turns on an agent — and the hook/event
 * surface those runs announce — lives in the `subagent` domain; the shared MCP
 * connection manager lives in the Workspace-scope `workspaceMcp` domain and
 * reaches agents through the seeded `ISessionMcpHandle`. Session-scoped — one
 * instance per session.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - The registry is flat: agents have no nesting. There is no parent/child or
 *   caller/callee relationship here; when a business domain needs such a
 *   relationship (e.g. the `Agent` tool's display events), that domain
 *   maintains it itself.
 * - No agent id is special: the main agent is an ordinary agent whose only
 *   distinction is the conventional `MAIN_AGENT_ID`, and nothing in this
 *   domain branches on it.
 * - Creation is single-flight per explicit agent id (concurrent creations
 *   join), an already-created agent is returned as-is, and a failed bootstrap
 *   drops the incomplete handle.
 * - `forkedFrom` is provenance only (a recorded value); business logic must
 *   not branch on it.
